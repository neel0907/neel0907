- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that having a good sense of humor can actually boost your immune system?
That's right! Studies have shown that laughter can increase the production of antibodies and immune cells, which helps your body fight off illness. So, not only does having a good sense of humor make you more fun to be around, but it can also help you stay healthy!
It's like a win-win situation. You get to enjoy life more, and your body gets a little extra protection. So go ahead, crack a joke, watch a funny movie, or just enjoy a good laugh. It's good for your health!
